# localStorage tutorial

 Demo for a tutorial showing how to use localStorage to save data in a very simple Phaser 3 game.
 
 The demo [can be found here](https://jerenaux.github.io/clicker/).
 
 The tutorial will be available soon.
 
 ## Running the demo ##
 
 Place all the files on your local web server and navigate to index.html.

This is a clicker game; you earn points by clicking repeatedly on the Phaser logo. Your score is displayed in the top-left corner. If you leave
and come back, your score will be unchanged because it is stored in your browser's localStorage!
